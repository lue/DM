\section{Do we capture all annihilation with this approach?}

Here we examine if the majority of annihilations indeed happen inside regions with $\delta \lt 200$. The answer is yes.



Instead of going directly to the actual calculation of the annihilation rate, we make an intermediate step. We reveal an underling global probability density function (PDF) of DM overdensity. The volume weighted PDF:

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{dV}{d\delta}(z)=\mathrm{PDF}_V (\delta, z) = \int_{M_\mathrm{min}}^\infty \dfrac{dn}{dM}(M,z) dM \int_{r_{\delta-\Delta/2}}^{r_{\delta+\Delta/2}} 4\pi r^2 dr / \Delta
\end{equation}

The rate of annihilations can be derived from PDF:
