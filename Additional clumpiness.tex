\section{Additional clumpiness}
\subsection{Scatter of concentrations}
In \cite{2014arXiv1407.4730D} (the very end of \S5.1) the authors report that 68\% rms scatter in $\log_{10}c_{200c}$ around median concentration is $\approx 0.16$ dex. Depending on the underlying distribution, it can increase the boosting factor by $15\%-50\%$. I use probability funcion as in \cite{2014arXiv1412.4308M}.

\subsection{Non-spherical halos}
Interesting discussion regarding clumpiness within a micro-halo is presented in \citet{Anderhalden_2013}. They found additional factor of a few at $z \sim 30$.

\subsection{Small clumps within large halos}
Discussion of clumps in Milky Way \cite{Belotsky_2014}.
