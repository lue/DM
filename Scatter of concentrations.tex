\subsection{Concentration model and scatter of concentrations}

Next ingridient is the model for concentrations. We adopt the model by \cite{2014arXiv1407.4730D}, which provides superior fits. Again, since the model is based on simulation, only masses higher $~10^{10}\;M_\odot$ are probed. However, this concentration fits are in fair agreement with the simulations of micro-mass halos at high (\~30) redshifts (see Figure 8 in \cite{2014arXiv1407.4730D}), which makes us optimistic about using it at lower masses and high redshifts.

Even though the average concentration for a halo of given mass is well defined, the scatter is not negligible. Therefore, we also integrate over the concentrations.

In \cite{2014arXiv1407.4730D} (the very end of \S5.1) the authors report that 68\% rms scatter in $\log_{10}c_{200c}$ around median concentration is $\approx 0.16$ dex. Depending on the underlying distribution, it can increase the boosting factor by $15\%-50\%$. We use probability distribution funcion of concentrations as in \cite{2014arXiv1412.4308M}. For our low, medium and high scenarios we adopt values of $\sigma_{\log_{10} c}$ 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 correspondingly.
