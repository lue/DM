\subsection{Scatter of concentrations}
In \cite{2014arXiv1407.4730D} (the very end of \S5.1) the authors report that 68\% rms scatter in $\log_{10}c_{200c}$ around median concentration is $\approx 0.16$ dex. Depending on the underlying distribution, it can increase the boosting factor by $15\%-50\%$. I use probability funcion as in \cite{2014arXiv1412.4308M}.
