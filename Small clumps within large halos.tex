\subsection{Subhalos}

The adopted mass function does not account for subhalos within halos. Therefore, we account for the contribution from the subhalos separately. Here we use the mass function in a form presented in \cite{Sanchez_Conde_2014} 

Discussion of clumps in Milky Way \cite{Belotsky_2014}.

The contribution from subhalos can be estimated with other methods like \cite{2015arXiv150802713Z}.

Subhalo mass function can be a function of concentration \cite{Mao_2015, Emberson_2015}.
