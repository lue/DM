The average rate of DM annihilations at redshift $z$ is proportional to the, $\langle \rho^2 \rangle$, the average of DM density squared. To calculate this value one needs to integrate over the volume. Unfortunatelly, the simulations of large scale structure do not have high enough resolution to pick up all substructure. Therefore we use approximate method based on converging the halos mass function and concentration relations.
