\subsection{DM annihilation efficiency for hydrogen ionization}
\label{sec:DMspectrum}

Here we will describe the calculation of the number of ionizations per one anihilation.

According the Equation 12 of \cite{Belikov_2009}, the number of ionization per photon of energy $E_\gamma$:
\begin{equation}
N_\mathrm{ion}(E_\gamma) \approx 2.4\times10^7\dfrac{E_\gamma}{1\,\mathrm{GeV}}
\end{equation}

On the other hand, in the \cite{Belikov_2010} (the last sentence of appendix) the photon spectrum of IC is normalaized to the total energy of electron/positron pair from annihilation. If I understand correctly, it leads to the conclusion that the number of ionization per annihilation is roughly a constant fraction (1/3) of $m_X/E_i$, where $m_X$ is the mass of DM particle and $E_i$ is the ionization threshold of hydrogen.
