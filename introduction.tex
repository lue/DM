\section{Introduction}

In \S\ref{sec:preliminaries} we discuss general questions and problems of calculations of dark matter annihilation.

In \S\ref{sec:origins_of_clumpiness} we describe each effect, which contribute to the clumpiness of DM and increases global boosting factor.

In Appendix we examine whether or not we capture all regions which significantly contribute to the total annihilation rate. In other words we check that annihilations in voids are insignificant.
