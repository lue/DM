\section{Introduction}

In order to estimate the effect of DM annihilation on the IGM during Dark Ages and the epoch of reionization, we need to take into account the following three components:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The boosting factor of DM  
\item The products of DM annihilation. We leave out scope of this paper the hadronization ... We use the spectrum of 
\item
\end{enumerate}
In \S\ref{sec:preliminaries} we discuss general questions and problems of calculations of dark matter annihilation.

In \S\ref{sec:origins_of_clumpiness} we describe each effect, which contribute to the clumpiness of DM and increases global boosting factor.

In \S\ref{sec:DMspectrum} we discuss the efficiency of hydrogen ionization by DM annihilation products.

In Appendix we examine whether or not we capture all regions which significantly contribute to the total annihilation rate. In other words we check that annihilations in voids are insignificant.
