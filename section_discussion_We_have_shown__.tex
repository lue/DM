\section{discussion}

We have shown that the DM annihilation can potentially alter the very early stages of reionizaiton. It starts to produce ionizing photons well before stars and therefore effectively contribute into the ionizing fraction. 

However, the optical depth $\tau$ is an additive scalar parameter, therefore we the effect from stars and the DM annihilation cannot be separated without additional information. Currently, the star and galaxy formation is very uncertain especially at high redshifts.

The 21cm data is a very powerful that will allow us to constraint the contribution from stars, but that would require assumption on the model of reionization . The DM annihilation does not accounted for into the classical approach.
