\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section we present results of of the actual calculations. We compare two quantities. First is the global boosting factor as a function of redshift. It is independent from the ionization history and DM annihilation properties. Therefore it only quantifies the slumpiness of DM. Second is the ionization fraction of the universe as if it is ionized solely by products of DM annihilation. Later we will combine DM contribution with stars.
